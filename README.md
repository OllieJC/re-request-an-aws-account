Reliability Engineering: Request an AWS Account
===============================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/alphagov/re-request-an-aws-account.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/alphagov/re-request-an-aws-account)


GDS use separate AWS accounts to manage isolation of services. This repo
contains the source for a form which allows teams to request a new account.

Accounts are created by the Reliability Engineering team, but provisioned and
owned by individual teams.
